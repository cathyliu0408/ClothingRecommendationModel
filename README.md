This project implements a deep learning model based on ResNet to recommend clothing items by analyzing images. It uses content-based image retrieval to find items similar to a given query image, focusing on features such as patterns, fabrics, and styles. The model is trained with a dataset prepared specifically for upper body clothing images, ensuring robustness in feature extraction and classification.
